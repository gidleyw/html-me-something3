                            <h2>Assassin's Creed: Valhalla</h2>
                                <h3>A fresh chapter in the Assassin's Creed 2 year cycle, another fun game.</h3>

                                    <p> 
                                        Assassin's Creed Valhalla (or ACV for short) is another classic in the AC timeline. 
                                        Ubisoft kept close to their AC design with the combat system as it feels very similar to AC: Origins and AC: Odyssey. This isn't bad - the combat is fun and has a good pace. 
                                        I'm not too sure what is going on in the story, just like the other AC entries there is a lot of filler, even if they are fun quests. 
                                        There's plenty of loot, tasks, and achievements in this AC which will keep anyone grinding for hours. The map is HUGE. 
                                        The scale can really be felt with the draw distance power of the PS5 as you can travel as far as you can see, and you can see FAR. 
                                        One reservation about the graphics, they seem a bit stale. There isn't enough movement in the terrain. 
                                        The leveling/skill system is akin to Final Fantasy X sphere grid - I see more games adopting this recently (looking at you Black Desert Online and Path of Exile) and I love it.

                            <h2>Call of Duty: Cold War</h2>
                                <h3>A fresh chapter in the Call of Duty annual year cycle narrowly hits target.</h3>
                                
                                    <p>
                                        Call of Duty: Cold War (COD: CW for short) barely is a not great, but definitely good game. Treyarch Studios specalizes in zombie modes and 
                                        zombies this year is a LOT of fun. Robust leveling system, lots of options and customization optinos, and a fun variety of zombies. 
                                        Zombie is very fast paced, fun, and anyone can play since this year the game walks you through the mode instead of throwing you to the wolves like last iterations. 
                                        The campaign tried to insert a "make your own ending" design which almost always results in a shallow campaign. This campaign had its COD awesome moments, but overall 
                                        was boring and I fell asleep on the last mission. Multiplayer is ok, biggest complaint is the movement makes me feel like I'm a ghost floating through the map. 
                                        The graphics as always with COD are A1 and you can tell. Overall Zombies is the only reason the game is still in my storage but it is a really good reason!

                            <h2>NBA 2K21</h2>
                                <h3>A fresh chapter in the NBA 2k annual year cycle - great as usual. </h3>
                                    <p>                        
                                        NBA 2K21 is another iteration to a great series. I've been playing 2K since AI was on the cover - 
                                        and most years they improve upon the last year, sometimes a half step back, but never an absolutely terrible game. The next gen upgrade to 2k is no exception. 
                                        Although not completely polished as there are some bugs, this 2K is REALLY smooth. 60 FPS makes a huge difference in sports video games and you can see it. 
                                        I have not played MyPlayer yet, but have played the MyNBA mode (which is similar to a 'franchise' mode). The defense AI is horrible though. I play on Hall of Fame and 
                                        the defenders are way to easy to cheese past as opposed to last editions. Very fun game though.

                                    <p>
                                        Although this is a PS4 game, this game was updated for the PS5. The PS5 updates make this game
                                        look and feel great. 60 FPS is very noticable difference from PS4 version. The combat is fast and smooth, 
                                        the challenge is there (you WILL die), and the story is resonating. I don't want to spoil much but you will see why this game had many GOTY awards.
                                        This game is amazing.
